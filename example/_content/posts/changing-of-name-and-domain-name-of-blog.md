Yesterday when I browsed [an article] of [Free Resources Horde](https://www.freehao123.com) (https://www.freehao123.com/freenom-tk-ml-ga-cf-gq/) As I mentioned in some people's comments, the free domain name in Freenom has little meaning, and the domain names like .win and .bid have only been dozens of pieces in Alibaba Cloud for ten years, decisively on Aliyun. The .win domain name renewal fee is 7 yuan a year, .bid is 5 yuan a year; and if registered, both are 4 yuan a year, .win is 18 yuan 3 years, .bid is 14 yuan 3 years. Although .bid is cheap, I checked it. Its meaning is related to "auction", so I chose the .win domain name of 18 yuan for 3 years.

When placing an order, the mobile phone APP can be reduced by 5 yuan for the first time, so the final result is that the domain name "gplane.win" has been obtained for only 3 years.

Because it is no longer the original "sealfu.cf" domain name, so the site name should be changed, and you will change the "Me.blog('GPlane');"
