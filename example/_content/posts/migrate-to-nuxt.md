recently spent a few days rewriting my blog with Nuxt.js.

# Nuxt.js Introduction

[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a Universal App Framework under Vue.js that can be used for SSR.
However, I used its `nuxt generate` function to staticize the page, basically implementing the function of the static site generator. (The reason why "basic" does not mean that Nuxt.js has limitations, but that my application itself is not fully static.)

# Why no longer use Hexo?

It's undeniable that Hexo's ecology is quite rich, and a variety of plug-ins can enhance the functionality of blogs; moreover, Hexo-generated sites are truly completely static, with little runtime overhead.

However, the various configurations under Hexo are relatively complex, and the current state of Hexo gives me the feeling that it is not efficient.

This page has an egg that is useless, and the kings can dig it on their own.
