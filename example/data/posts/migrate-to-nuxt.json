(The reason why &quot;basic&quot; does not mean that Nuxt.js has limitations, but that my application itself is not fully static.)</p>\n<h1>Why no longer use Hexo?</h1>\n<p>It's undeniable that Hexo's ecology is quite rich, and a variety of plug-ins can enhance the functionality of blogs; moreover, Hexo-generated sites are truly completely static, with little runtime overhead.</p>\n<p>However, the various configurations under Hexo are relatively complex, and the current state of Hexo gives me the feeling that it is not efficient.</p>\n<p>This page has an egg that is useless, and the kings can dig it on their own.</p>\n"
